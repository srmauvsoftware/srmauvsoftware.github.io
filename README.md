## About

**SRMAUV** is an under-graduate student team of SRM Institute of Science and Technology, founded in the year 2013. We the team of underwater robotics enthusiasts share our common interest in designing of AUVs(Autonomous Underwater Vehicles). The team comprises of members of several domains starting from Computer Science, Electrical and Mechatronics. The team works around the year to publish papers on underwater robotics and prototyping our new vehicle. The team is currently working on its fifth iteration of the vehicle ZARNA 2.0.
The team participates in various national and internal competitions such as Robosub
