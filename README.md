## About

**SRMAUV** is an under-graduate student team of SRM Institute of Science and Technology, founded in the year 2013. This team of underwater robotics enthusiasts share our common interest in designing Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. It comprises of members of several domains including Computer Science, Electrical and Mechatronics. Currently building the fifth iteration of the vehicle (ZARNA 2.0), the team works around the year doing research in underwater robotics, prototyping models, and testing the vehicle. The team participates in various national and international competitions such as [Robosub](https://robosub.org/), [NIOT SAVe](ttp://www.indiamts.com/activities%20Report/6th_National_Competition_on_Student_Autonomous_underwater_Vehicle_SAVe_2019.pdf) and [SAUVC](https://sauvc.org/).
